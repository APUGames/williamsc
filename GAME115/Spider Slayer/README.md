## Description

In Spider Slayer, you will progress by facing spiders and overcoming trials. Your journey begins with the main character preparing to go to sleep (this is how the players learn the controls) and as you start to fade into slumber, you wake up pumped to go on your daily patrol. You pick up your sword and proceed outside the house. The townsfolk will guide you to where your journey truly begins. 

Will you be able to overcome the trials that your family has faced and follow in their footsteps? 

The mechanics of the game on the web includes Z, X, Enter (Start), Shift (Select), WASD (movement) and on GameBoy, A, B, Start, Select, D-Pad (movement).

You must find and interact with items in order to defend yourself from the phobias.
